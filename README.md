## My name is Alexander Trofimov

I am an aspiring programmer, graduated from BSUIR. 
I have experience with Python and frontend development,
and now I am fully dedicated to learning mobile 
development for iOS. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning 
iOS and find the platform incredibly engaging and user-friendly.
As I continue to expand my skills, I am actively seeking
internship opportunities where I can apply my knowledge
and gain hands-on development experience.
