## My name is Alexander Trofimov

I am a novice programmer currently studying at BSUIR. I have a background in Python and front-end development, and I am currently dedicated to learning mobile iOS development. I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience learning iOS, and I find the platform to be incredibly fascinating and user-friendly. The process of building iOS applications has been both challenging and rewarding, and I have been able to create some personal pet projects that I am proud of. As I continue to expand my skills, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my knowledge and gain practical experience in iOS development.
